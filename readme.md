# Looking Under the hood of a neural network

### prerequisite

I am assuming that you have a basic understanding of neural netowrks and how to make a normal mlp.

### MLP vs CNN

* To feed an image into a MLP we convert this image which can be represed by a 2d array into a vector of numbers.
* The MLP has no idea that this numbers were spatially arraged to represent an images.
* CNNs accept matrices (2d arrays as input).
* MLP uses fulley connected networks.
* CNNs uses sparcely connected networks.
